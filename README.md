    youtube-dl --version

This should give you a response, if not, try intalling it

### APT

### Snap

## Running donwTube
As it is on a early access stage, it doesn't show a download progress for now, a simple solution to see progress is placing on  the application root and open a terminal

    ~/downTube 1.0a$ ./downTube

This way the program shows it's window and a progress on the console while downloading.
