A youtube-dl graphic shell written in QT5 C++

## Dependencies
As a youtube-dl grhaphic interface this program depends on it. Before running downTube make sure you have youtube-dl

    youtube-dl --version

This should give you a response, if not, try intalling it

### APT

    sudo apt-get install youtube-dl

### Snap

    sudo snap install youtube-dl

## Running donwTube
As it is on a early access stage, it doesn't show a download progress for now but it notifies when the download is finished, a simple solution (for now) to see progress is placing on the application root and open a terminal

    user@user-pc:~/downTube Folder$ ./downTube

This way the program shows it's window and a progress on the console while downloading.
